Q: What does pre-purchase inspection include?
A: When buying a used car it's often hard to tell what you are getting and if it's really worth the price you are paying for it. Not to mention getting stuck with a car with a serious problem. This is why we strongly recommend a pre-purchase inspection. It can save you a lot of money and potential headaches. Pre-Purchase Inspection includes: Mechanical condition evaluation, Faults survey printout, and Expected future maintenance cost assessment. There is a $195 fee for your first pre-purchase inspection. You can schedule up to three additional inspections free of charge if done within 30 days. We only perform pre-purchase inspections on BMWs, Porsches, Mercedes and Mini Coopers.
